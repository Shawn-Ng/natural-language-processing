    "- Python's assignment and parameter passing use object references; e.g. if a is a list and we assign b = a, then any operation on a will modify b, and vice versa.\n",
    "- The is operation tests if two objects are identical internal objects, while == tests if two objects are equivalent. This distinction parallels the type-token distinction.\n",
    "- Strings, lists and tuples are different kinds of sequence object, supporting common operations such as indexing, slicing, len(),  sorted(), and membership testing using in.\n",
    "- A declarative programming style usually produces more compact, readable code; manually-incremented loop variables are usually unnecessary; when a sequence must be enumerated, use enumerate().\n",
    "- Functions are an essential programming abstraction: key concepts to understand are parameter passing, variable scope, and docstrings.\n",
    "- A function serves as a namespace: names defined inside a function are not visible outside that function, unless those names are declared to be global.\n",
    "- Modules permit logically-related material to be localized in a file. A module serves as a namespace: names defined in a module — such as variables and functions — are not visible to other modules, unless those names are imported.\n",
    "- Dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique used widely in NLP that stores the results of previous computations in order to avoid unnecessary recomputation."
